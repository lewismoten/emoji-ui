# Features

- Toggle theme between light, dark, and high contrast.
- Toggle the emoji size displayed
- Search emoji by name
- Change view to shot just the emoji, buttons with the emoji names, or full detailed list including name, title, unicode codepoints with ES6 encoding.
- Select an emoji to view detailed information about it.

# Development

Just run `npm start`. The script will build the code, start up a local webserver, and display the site in your browser.

# Demo

Everything needed to setup as a static website can be found in the `dist` folder, starting with `index.html`.

An interactive demonstration of the `dist` folder is also hosted on GitHub pages.

This is a small project of me playing around with different technologies to stay up to date with the latest tech. The stack includes webpack, babel, react, redux, and rsuite.
